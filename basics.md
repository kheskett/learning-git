# Git Basics

* git init - creates a new git repository in the current folder.

* nano basics.md (or other file name)  - and it opens the editor with 
the document ready to change

* git status - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the 
repository.

* git add  - Places one or more files in the staging area.

* cat basics.md (or other filename) view the file contents

* git commit - m "document git status command"  it is how you add 
document to the repository with the recent changes.

* git log  - show the data on changes, e.g., how many commits have been 
done.

* git diff  - use to show some of the version info.

* git diff HEAD~1 basics.md (or other file name) to look back in history 
and can futher compare with  git diff HEAD..HEAD~1.

if there is a problem, then can use 
*git checkout basics.md which takes the file back to the last 'commit' 
version.
